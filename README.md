# Simple Banking System
This is a simple banking system using a database to store credit card accounts. 
Credit card numbers are created using the Luhn algorithm. The program allows a user to 
create a new credit card account. The user can then log in to their account, check their 
balance, transfer money to another account, and close an account. Properties of created 
accounts are stored and updated at the end of each session in a database using SQL. The 
name of the database to connect to is passed as an argument to the main class.
